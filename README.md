# Get-Temp
This is an example I created to get the current temperature from my weather station as uploaded to wunderground.com.  

The code is developed in RPG and SQL to run on an IBMi (AS400).

The 2 source files are:

gettemp.sql - Stand alone SQL statement.
gettemp.sqlrpgle - RPG program which includes the SQL statement above.
